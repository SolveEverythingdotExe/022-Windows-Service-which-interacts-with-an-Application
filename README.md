Windows Service which interacts with an Application

This project shows how an Application (Windows Form) can send commands to a Windows Service.

Note:
You maybe need to run the command prompt as an administrator to be able to use properly the InstallUtil.exe.
You maybe also need to run the Application (MainApplication.exe) or Visual Studio as an administrator since it will connect to a Windows Service.
